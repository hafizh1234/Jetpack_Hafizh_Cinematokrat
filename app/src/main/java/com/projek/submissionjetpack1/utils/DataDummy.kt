He was raised in an Army family, meaning that for most of his early life, his father — an officer in the Royal Engineers — was absent. Ridley's older brother, Frank, joined the Merchant Navy when he was still young and the pair had little contact. During this time the family moved around, living in (among other areas) Cumbria, Wales and Germany. He has a younger brother, Tony, also a film director. After the Second World War, the Scott family moved back to their native north-east England, eventually settling in Teesside (whose industrial landscape would later inspire similar scenes in Blade Runner). He enjoyed watching films, and his favourites include Lawrence of Arabia, Citizen Kane and Seven Samurai. Scott studied in Teesside from 1954 to 1958, at Grangefield Grammar School and later in West Hartlepool College of Art, graduating with a Diploma in Design. He progressed to an M.A. in graphic design at the Royal College of Art from 1960 to 1962",

It starred Emmy and Golden Globe winning actress America Ferrera (Ugly Betty, How To Train Your Dragon), Tony Plana (Goal, 187), and David Sutcliffe (Gilmore Girls, Private Practice). At the festival, the film was picked up for distribution by Peace Arch Entertainment and MGM. Subsequently, Negret's talent was recognized and highlighted by The Hollywood Reporter as part of their 'Top 10 Latino Directors to watch'.\n\nSubsequent to the \"Towards Darkness\" premiere, Negret developed the script for \"Operation Checkmate,\" a thriller for Screen Gems about the real-life rescue of Ingrid Betancourt. He also directed two feature films - \"Seconds Apart\" and \"Transit.\" \"Seconds Apart,\" an After Dark Films production, was released by Lionsgate. The film stars Orlando Jones (Runaway Jury, Evolution) as a detective trying to solve a series of mysterious deaths connected to a pair of twins.\n\n\"Transit\" stars Jim Caviezel(Passion of the Christ, The Count of Monte Cristo), James Frain (Tron:Legacy, Trueblood), Harold Perrnieau (Lost, Romeo+Juliet) and Elisabeth Rhom (Heroes, Miss Congeniality 2). \"Transit\" is executive produced by Joel Silver (Sherlock Homes, The Matrix).\n\nEarly in his career, Negret directed multiple award winning short films. He also directed two seasons of the weekly television series \"Not So Foreign Filmmakers Showcase.\" The show encompassed sketches and interviews with celebrity guests, among which included Virginia Madsen, Rosario Dawson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jay Hernandez, and Robert Rodriguez.\n\nNegret has lived and worked in Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, England, and the United States.

He was raised in an Army family, meaning that for most of his early life, his father — an officer in the Royal Engineers — was absent. Ridley's older brother, Frank, joined the Merchant Navy when he was still young and the pair had little contact. During this time the family moved around, living in (among other areas) Cumbria, Wales and Germany. He has a younger brother, Tony, also a film director. After the Second World War, the Scott family moved back to their native north-east England, eventually settling in Teesside (whose industrial landscape would later inspire similar scenes in Blade Runner). He enjoyed watching films, and his favourites include Lawrence of Arabia, Citizen Kane and Seven Samurai. Scott studied in Teesside from 1954 to 1958, at Grangefield Grammar School and later in West Hartlepool College of Art, graduating with a Diploma in Design. He progressed to an M.A. in graphic design at the Royal College of Art from 1960 to 1962",
